        <p>In securing a job, the most impactful experiences:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Relevant work experience</li>
            <li>Internship</li>
            <li>Relevant Project Work. Sometimes, this is more valuable than 1 or 2.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            I'm seeking QF students who want to have #3 on their CVs. 
            We will colloborate on a software <span style="text-decoration: line-through">project</span> system that 
            you can point to as evidence of (1) concrete technical skills and (2) exposure to financial markets.
        </p>

        <p>
            A skillgap between "quant finance" and "computational finance" is technical aspects of electronic markets. Even if you do not intend on being a quant developer, 
            expertise in market microstructure is useful to quant finance. Trading and Strategy is just the top of the iceberg. 90% of QF is 
            the data and technical infrastructure. Understanding how this infrastructure is built will better equip you to be 
            a quant analyst, researcher, trader. For some firms, especially "colloborative funds" like TwoSigma and Jane Street, 
            being a tech company is their DNA and market edge.
        </p>

        <p>
            In general, there is a gap between academia and industry needs. For example, every job in QF will require SQL.
            Through this colloboration, SQL will be one of the concrete skills you can highlight on your resume.
        </p>

        <h2>Precedent</h2>

        <p><strong>Quantopian</strong> was a platform where users developed and shared algo trading strategies written in Python. You could backtest against historical data and simulate P&L with walk-forward tests. Point72 (Steve Cohen) was a VC; the business model was crowd-sourced hedge fund&mdash;aggregate the best strategies, trade with their own capital, share profits with authors.
            In my opinion, this business model is difficult to align with VC funding schedules. They were ahead of their time, running out of runway in 2020 before the rise of LLMs. 
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "To fill the gap left by Quantopian, traders have relied on open source projects like Gekko and Freqtrade. The first companies to capitalize were CrunchDAO, QuantConnect, and Numerai. Recently, cloud-based tools emerged for crypto: 3commas, Mudrex, and Tuned."<br>
            &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantopian">Wikipedia</a>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The space remains niche and the tech last-gen. Meanwhile, there's a confluence of:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Millions of laid-off tech workers with time, money, and skills to trade</li>
            <li>Oversupply of CS grads; employers favor senior hires who can lever AI</li>
            <li>QF is part of the lexicon and no longer esoterica by Ryan Gosling in <em>The Big Short</em></li>
            <li>Retail traders are dialing in globally (Korean retail traders DDOS Western stock live streams. Their senior citizens enrolling in Technical Analysis coursees)</li>
            <li>Interest in markets: Polymarket, crypto, prediction markets</li>
            <li>A US administration that doesn't shy away from market-moving headlines 
                and encouraging inflows: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/trumpaccounts">https://www.irs.gov/trumpaccounts</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Interest in quant trading is higher than ever. Competition for institutional jobs is fierce. Rebels <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSura5YiPpC">aspiring to start hedge funds from dorm rooms</a> garner millions of views.</p>
        <p>AI has enabled non-engineers to build software applications and businesses. Why not algo trading strategies and firms? If Robinhood democratized trading for retail; this project aim to democratize algo trading.</p>

        <h2>Workstream #1: Historical Trading Simulator</h2>

        <p>In <em>Dune</em>, characters possess prescience&mdash;the ability to see the future.
            Prescient enables space navigation by avoiding debris. In combat, people outmaneuveur opponents.
        </p>
        <p>Another sci-fi plot device is to travel back in time, use the knowledge you have now, profit.
            People joke about these "what ifs" scenarios on WallStreetBets. 
            It's a pain in the ass to actually lookup historical prices and sequence out these 
            these trades in Excel. LLMs are also not well optimized 
            for these stock market queries especially outside the largest 100 stocks, and I'll loop back to how 
            we can build a better LLM later.
        </p>

        <p>I built a "game" where you start in January 2020 before the GameStop short squeeze with $1,000. On each trading day, you can: (1) buy a ticker, (2) sell the ticker you are holding, or (3) continue to the next trading.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/manual.png" alt="Perfect-Liquidity Simulator" class="screenshot">
        </figure>

        <p>200% here, 500% there, and a few hundred clicks later you're a millionaire.</p>

        <p>In the real world:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slippage:</strong> You want to buy 100,000 shares at $5. Only 50,000 is filled because the stock rose higher.</li>
            <li><strong>Market impact:</strong> Jensen Huang's net worth = number of NVDA shares owned * NVDA stock price.
                He can never actually sell those many shares at the market price without dragging the price down.
            </li>
            <li>Brokerage fees and commissions for every trade</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            There will be disparity between a trading strategy and <strong>trade execution</strong>. 
            Firms also have to consider tax implications. One area of work is incorporating these factors.
            In doing so, you have talking points when interviewing with trading firms.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Another area of work is making the simulator more general:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Granularity:</strong> Instead of each turn being a day, we can generalize to every hour. This would require getting more granular data then just 
                the stock's OLHC (open, low, high, close) price on the day. The intradata data for this simulator came from scraping from Yahoo! Finance. Supporting 
                interday trading would require gettiing other data sources.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Being able to hold more than 1 stock at a same time. This also means specifying how many shares to buy 
                and sell instead of the current "full porting" (spend all the cash you have on a single stock) simplication.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Volume:</strong> This goes hand in hand with granularity. If in an hour, only 10000 shares were historically moved, 
                it might not have been possible to trade 100,000 shares. This gets into issues with the orderbook (see workstream #6)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Your ideas and improvements are welcomed!
        </p>
    
        <h2>Workstream #2: Algo trading</h2>

        <p>Instead of manually clicking, people can code a "bot" to do it. It's a function as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input: </strong> the current position, data such as today's opening price, yesterday's closing price, the weather, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Output: </strong> buy, sell, or hold</li>
        </ul>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/algo.png" alt="Algo trading interface" class="screenshot">
            <figcaption>Left: code editor with a simple random-walk strategy. Right: simulator state. Bottom: input data passed to the function, output decision.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Voilà: a crude algo trading R&D and backtesting platform.</p>

        <p>Past performance is not indicative of future performance.
            Users want to know if the algo trading strategy was overfitted to the past and will work moving forward. 
            Simple, we run the same user-specified function for the next 30 days (in simulator) and provide a dashboard where 
            they can review the performance of all their trading strategies. Voilà: walk-forward testing.
        </p>

        <p>
            There will be various other dashboards and tools to review things such as variance, drawdown, Sharpe ratio. 
            Users can compare performance versus index performance (did the strategy just do well because the entire market 
            moved up, or because of inflation?). Basically, packaging up all the statistics and math stuff we're learning right here. 
        </p>

        <h2>Workstream #3: Market Interface</h2>

        <p>
            Instead of walk-forward test against the simulator, we talk to an actual stock brokerage that the user has linked
            to execute the trades such as Charles Schwab, 
            Interactive Brokers or Alpaca. Voilà: an algo trading platform. If we support crypto, Coinbase and Binance. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Having experiences with these brokerages would move you to the front of the line if you wanted to apply for a job. 
            If we allowed people buying Vanguard ETFs, we integrate with Vanguard directly. There's also sorts of details 
            to be learnt about Vanguard ETFs in the process. 
        </p>

        <p>Users can allocate a $1,000 account to one strategy, $2,000 to another. We provide a user interface 
            to review the aggregate performance. Voilà: multi-strat diversication. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Once we're brave enough, we integrate directly with exchanges. We wouldn't be able to allow 
            the general public to use this feature because we'd have to be regulated financial institution / broker. 
            Suppose we just expose this feature for admin users such as ourselves. This integration would involve C++,
            the FIX protocol, and deep experience with market microstructure. 
        </p>

        <h2>Workstream #4: Data Platform</h2>

        <p>Currently the app has 5 years of data for 6 stocks:</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="assets/tickers.png" alt="Available tickers" class="screenshot" style="max-width: 320px;">
            <figcaption>AAPL, AMC, GME, NVDA, RGTI, TSLA</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>No reason to stop there:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>15+ years of historical data</li>
            <li>3,000+ US stocks, European stocks, Asian stocks, crypto, any tradeable asset</li>
            <li>
                Option chains and Derivatives
            </li>
            <li>Bonds</li>
            <li>Commodoties</li>
            <li>Not just price&mdash;volume, fundamentals, alternative data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each of these asset classes have to be treated differently. For bonds, we want to represent data about maturity 
            and interest rates. For stocks, dividend payouts, normalizing for stock splits, accounting for delistings, IPOs. 
            I have no idea what information might be relevant for corn futures. 
            For options, we want to collect data about open contracts.
            This is the whole point where we learn more about these different asset classes. 
        </p>

        <p>Once we provide an interface for querying arbitrary data, we've formed the basis of a data platform. Aggregate news? Now we're approaching Bloomberg and <a href="https://godelterminal.com/">Shkreli's Godel Terminal</a>. Add social media sentiment from Instagram and TikTok? Relatively new because 
        this information is generally siloed, atleast to the general public</p>

        <p>
            Ocean tide schedule. Traffic information. Crime data. There's no limit. Are the information useful and relevant? 
            Well, we will <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfood</a></strong> and make this platform a place where we can R&D trading strategies 
            off this <strong>alternative data</strong>
        </p>

        <p>

        <h2>Workstream #5: Language ecosystem and Compilers</h2>

        <p>JavaScript will be the DSL (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language</a>) for algo trading. JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world, yet there's no finance ecosystem or "mindshare" around it, yet.
            There are millions of webdevs who'd try algo trading if the barrier were lower.
        </p>

        <h3>DataFrame</h3>

        <p>Python has NumPy, Pandas, and now Polars (Optiver is a sponsor). At Jane Street, one intern project was <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2024-edition-index/">porting Polars to OCaml</a>. If we port Polars to JavaScript, that's a talking point for interviews at firms using or interested in migrating to Polars.</p>

        <h3>Ecosystem</h3>

        <p> JavaScript is not known for Stats/ML/finance libraries like Python.
            For example, SciKit Learn in Python.
            This is an opportunity to pioneer data libraries that other people can depend on. 
            You will solidify your stats knowledge in the process. 
            Since Python already has these libraries, 
            there is little opportunity for us to be a key contributor there. </p>
            <p>
            Python is popular for data work because people created data libraries for it, then a community formed. 
            This is developer mindshare&mdash;an anthropological phenomenon, not Python being fundamentally superior. 
            We can do the same and be a critical part of the ecosystem and supply chain. Jane Street famously picked up most of the OCaml ecosystem contributors.</p>

        <h3>Compilers</h3>

        <p>Another workstream: taking users' JavaScript algos and converting them to something fast&mdash;C++ (lingua franca of quant finance) or Rust (gaining popularity) 
            when we actually execute in the real world. This is compilers work. It's worth pointing out that most of Jane Street's technical interns work on language/compilers projects: <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/wrought-2025/">https://blog.janestreet.com/wrought-2025/</a></p>

        <h3>C++</h3>

        <p>Every HFT fund uses C++. Stock exchanges are written in C++. Most of finance use C++. 
            Various aspects of this project will involve C++ code:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>High-performance backtesting engine</li>
            <li>Exchange connectivity and market data parsing</li>
            <li>Compilation targets for user strategies</li>
            <li>Latency-critical execution paths</li>
        </ul>

        
    <h2>Workstream #6: Level3</h2>
    <p>
        See <a href="https://databento.com/microstructure/level-3-market-data">What is level3 market data</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the most granular market data. It is tick-by-tick and individual trades.
        The simulator aggregate prices and volume, but tick data allows us to reproduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book</a> 
        at any given point in time. Certain trading strategies involve market depth.
        This is literally where Flow Traders derive their name from: analyzing order flow: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_flow_trading">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_flow_trading</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The scale of this data will require something like C++ and a time series database. 
        This will also involve undersanding market making and implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_matching_system">order-matching system</a>. 
    </p>

    <h2>Workstream #7: IDE</h2>

    <p>
        R has RStudios. Java has Intellij. 
        These IDEs understand the language and give the user cues. For us, this would be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            provide autocomplete if users type out a stock ticker when implementing their trading strategy. 
        </li>
        <li>
            warn about numerical and rounding issues 
        </li>
        <li>
            complain that the user forgot to return a buy/sell/hold decision in one of their code branches
        </li>
         <li>
            warn about logic bugs such as the user attempting to buy more stock then they have more money for, in a non-margin account
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The AI coding agent Cursor is built around VSCode/Monaco. JaneStreet built around Emacs. 
        I've built a new text editor for the web here: <a href="https://varrockbank.github.io/buffee/">Buffee</a>.
